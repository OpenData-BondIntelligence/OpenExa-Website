                        Mike, a seasoned software architect with a passion for
                        solving complex real-time system challenges, including
                        those in the realm of blockchain. With a wealth of
                        experience in the field, Mike has served as an architect
                        on several high-stakes real-time business systems,
                        including the initial online banking transaction
                        processing system for Washington Mutual. As a key player
                        at Paper Exchange, a Boston-based start-up that
                        revolutionized online exchange transactions in the
                        forest products industry, Mike's innovative work
                        eventually led to the acquisition of the company by a
                        German firm, PaperSpace. At Microsoft, Mike held the
                        title of principal architect, where he designed and
                        executed a comprehensive global pricing system that
                        touched upon 90% of Microsoft's revenues. This included
                        an optimal real-time pricing and quoting system, and a
                        massive product and price data warehouse used by
                        Microsoft on a global scale. Mike's exceptional work has
                        been recognized with a patent for a real-time
                        rules-based algorithm processing system and his
                        expertise extends to two real-time embedded software
                        essential avionics systems on the Boeing 737/757/767.<br /><br />
